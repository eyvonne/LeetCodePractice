## LeetCode Practice

This is a repo of my interview prep practice problems that I've solved. These are
mostly loosely organized notes for my own purposes to see what I've already done. 

I have started to always write unittests to go along with my leetcode solutions to check myself. 
These tests have been placed in folders alongside the code they check. 

The in_progress folder represents things that I have not finished solving. I intend to come back to these.
